# Exercise 3: Boosting and AdaBoost

This project is part of the **Introduction to Machine Learning** course at **HUJI**. The focus of this exercise is to implement the **AdaBoost** algorithm, explore its performance, and analyze its application using weak classifiers like decision stumps.

## Project Structure

- **`adaboost.py`**: Contains the implementation of the AdaBoost algorithm, using weak classifiers to build a strong classifier through boosting.
- **`adaboost_scenario.py`**: Runs scenarios with AdaBoost, visualizing the results and performance.
- **`decision_stump.py`**: Implements decision stumps, which are used as the weak classifiers in the AdaBoost algorithm.
- **`loss_functions.py`**: Provides loss functions to evaluate the performance of the boosting algorithm.
- **`Answers.pdf`**: Contains the theoretical background and analysis of the results from this exercise.
