# Exercise 4: Logistic Regression and Gradient Descent Investigation

This project is part of the **Introduction to Machine Learning** course at **HUJI**. In this exercise, the focus is on implementing **logistic regression** using **gradient descent**. The project also investigates the impact of various learning rates and optimization techniques on the convergence of gradient descent.

## Project Structure

- **`logistic_regression.py`**: Implements logistic regression using gradient descent as the optimization method.
- **`gradient_descent.py`**: Provides general functions for gradient descent optimization.
- **`gradient_descent_investigation.py`**: Investigates the behavior of gradient descent with different learning rates and visualizes the convergence process.
- **`learning_rate.py`**: Implements learning rate adjustments and strategies for tuning the gradient descent process.
- **`modules.py`**: Contains utility functions and modules for matrix operations, logistic regression, and other helper functions.
- **`Answers.pdf`**: Contains theoretical answers and the detailed analysis of the gradient descent investigation.
