# Exercise 2: Classifier Evaluation and Loss Functions

This project is part of the **Introduction to Machine Learning** course at **HUJI**. The focus of this exercise is to implement and evaluate several classification models using different loss functions and metrics.

## Project Structure

- **`classifiers.py`**: Contains implementations of classifiers such as **Naive Bayes**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**.
- **`classifiers_evaluation.py`**: Provides functions to evaluate classifier performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **`loss_functions.py`**: Implements various loss functions like **Hinge Loss**, **Cross-Entropy Loss**, and **Mean Squared Error**.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the required Python libraries to run the project.
- **`Answers.pdf`**: Contains the theoretical background and answers to the exercise questions.
