# Exercise 1: House Price Prediction & Temperature Analysis

This project is part of the **Introduction to Machine Learning** course at **HUJI**. The main focus of this exercise is to explore regression techniques like **Linear Regression** and **Polynomial Fitting** to predict house prices and analyze city temperature data over time.

## Project Structure

- **`house_price_prediction.py`**: Implements linear and polynomial regression models to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage and location.
- **`city_temperature_prediction.py`**: Predicts city temperatures using polynomial regression models, exploring the relationships between time and temperature in various locations.
- **`linear_regression.py`**: Contains helper functions for implementing and evaluating linear regression models.
- **`polynomial_fitting.py`**: Provides functions for fitting and evaluating polynomial models on datasets.
- **`Answers.pdf`**: Contains the theoretical background and answers to the mathematical questions posed in the exercise.
